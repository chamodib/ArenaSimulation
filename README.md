# ArenaSimulation

This project aims to simulate a model of the given case (SM Travel) using Arena Simulation software. The project was completed to the best of mine and my projectmates' abilities using the free student version of the software which has limited resources and modules. A short prompt of the case is below, with the whole case study and the final Arena file and final report within the repository. 

---------------------------- CASE --------------------------------

SM Travel is in the process of consolidating our current small travel offices into two new
locations that will handle all requests by phone. With the recent reduction in business
travel and the general condition of the travel industry, we find it necessary to reduce our
operating cost. Our current plan is to locate the first office in the U.S. and the second at a
yet-to-be-determined overseas site. The U.S. site would handle all calls between 7 AM and
7 PM EST, with the overseas site handling calls from 7 PM to 7 AM EST.

SM Travel has employed several consultants to collect data and develop a design for
the proposed consolidation. Although we’ve received sufficient information to proceed
with the implementation of the design, we question the actual operating cost of the new
system. The two major costs are associated with employees and phone lines, but the uncertainty of the operating cost compels us to request recommendations. We ask you to
evaluate the current design and propose a configuration that will result in (approximately)
minimizing operating cost while still achieving the desired customer-service levels.

It’s obvious that we could intentionally overstaff the systems as a way of always
meeting the projected customer demand, but it is understood that a design that always
meets demand may result in a very expensive system with reduced profitability. We’d
like to be able to size this system so that we meet or exceed customer requirements while
keeping our investment and operating costs at an approximate minimum. We explored
several options to resolve this problem and have concluded that computer simulation
may well provide the technology necessary to size this system properly. With this in
mind, we’ll describe the operating policies and general design of the proposed system, as
well as include data where available.
